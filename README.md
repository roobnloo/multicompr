## multicompr : Conservative confidence intervals for multiple comparisons.

Provided a linear model with a categorical predictor along with a matrix of coefficients, we provide conservative simultaneous confidence bounds for the contrasts given by the matrix.

For each contrast, we compute the confidence intervals given by the Bonferroni correction and Scheffe's S-method. We report the shortest of these for each contrast.
